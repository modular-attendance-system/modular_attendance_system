The Modular Advanced Attendance System (MAAS) is a full-stack application built to prove the fundamental interaction for a live attendance system. [cite_start]The primary objective of this project is to create a solid, end-to-end foundation for a minimal but complete system, upon which future complexity and features can be built. [cite: 5, 6, 7]

The core user journey involves an administrator creating a unique attendance session, which generates a QR code. [cite_start]A user can then scan this code with their mobile device to be marked as 'present' in real-time on the administrator's dashboard. [cite: 9]

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   [cite_start]**Admin Authentication:** Secure login for administrators to manage sessions. [cite: 24]
-   [cite_start]**Session Management:** Admins can create and name new attendance sessions on demand. [cite: 25]
-   [cite_start]**Unique QR Code Generation:** The system generates a unique QR code for each active session for users to scan. [cite: 18, 26]
-   [cite_start]**Real-time Attendance Dashboard:** A live web dashboard that lists all users and automatically updates their status (Present/Absent) as they scan in. [cite: 22, 28]
-   [cite_start]**Mobile QR Code Scanning:** A simple, user-facing mobile app with a single button to scan the session QR code using the device's camera. [cite: 31, 33]

## üöÄ Tech Stack

-   [cite_start]**Frontend (Admin Web App):** React / Next.js [cite: 54]
-   [cite_start]**Frontend (User Mobile App):** Flutter / React Native [cite: 61]
-   [cite_start]**Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (assumed), WebSockets for real-time updates. [cite: 49]
-   [cite_start]**Database:** PostgreSQL [cite: 46]
-   **Authentication:** JWT (assumed for token-based auth)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

-   Node.js (v18.x or higher)
-   A mobile development environment (Flutter or React Native)
-   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vibhutomer/modular_attendance_system.git](https://github.com/vibhutomer/modular_attendance_system.git)
    cd modular_attendance_system
    ```
2.  Install all dependencies for the frontend and backend:
    ```bash
    npm run install:all
    ```
3.  Set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file inside the `packages/backend/` directory and add the following required variables:
    ```
    # .env file for the backend
    PORT=3001
    DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string_here"
    JWT_SECRET="your_strong_jwt_secret_here"
    ```
4.  Run the entire application (frontend and backend concurrently):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    -   The admin web app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or as configured)
    -   The backend server will be running at `http://localhost:3001`

The Modular Attendance System is a full-stack application designed to streamline the process of tracking attendance. It solves the problem of manual, error-prone attendance methods by providing a seamless digital experience for both administrators and users.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time QR Code Generation:** Dynamic QR codes for secure and session-specific check-ins.
- **Detailed Analytics Dashboard:** Visualize attendance data, track trends, and monitor engagement.
- **Automated Report Generation:** Export daily, weekly, or monthly attendance reports in PDF or CSV format.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Separate interfaces and permissions for administrators and users.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Machine Learning:** Python, Scikit-learn (for potential future analytics)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB (Choose one)
- **Deployment:** Docker, Vercel (for frontend), AWS/Heroku (for backend)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
